*Juelich, Germany ~ March 26 - April 8, 2017*

Techniques to record neuronal data from single neurons and population of neurons are rapidly improving. Meanwhile recordings are possible from hundreds of channels simultaneously while animals perform complex tasks. Thus also the analysis of such data becomes increasingly challenging. This advanced course aims at providing deeper insights in state-of-the-art questions in neuroscience, analysis approaches and how to formalize questions to neuronal data so they can be answered quantitatively.


## [Neurobiology (DL: February 1, 2017)](http://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/neurobiology/)
*Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, US ~ June 2 - July 31, 2017*

A hallmark of this course is the extensive lab work done in close collaboration with expert faculty. The course is divided into three sections: Electrophysiology, Imaging, and Molecular Neurobiology. These are taught by separate groups of faculty, usually six in each section, and with many guest lecturers. Each section begins with specific training in core laboratory techniques; students then undertake one- to two-week directed or independent projects using the methods they have learned. Didactic lectures are combined with laboratory experience in order to establish a strong conceptual foundation for each section. A typical day has 3 hours of lecture and 10 hours of lab.

Electrophysiological methods focus on patch-clamp and sharp electrode recordings, performed on neurons in a variety of preparations, including tissue culture, brain slices, isolated squid synapses, rat cochlea, or whole fish. Optical methods include calcium imaging, confocal and 2-photon microscopy, videomicroscopy, and electron microscopy. Molecular techniques emphasize the use of forward and reverse genetics in diverse systems such as Drosophila, C. elegans, zebrafish, chick embryos, and primary cells in culture. The impact of genetic manipulations are assayed by real time PCR, laser microdissection, single cell PCR, in situ hybridization, and a variety of immunotechniques in addition to incorporating electrophysiological and imaging techniques.

The goal of the course is to emphasize the strengths of a multidisciplinary approach for studying the function of the nervous system at the cellular and molecular levels.


## [Neural Systems & Behavior (DL: February 1, 2017)](http://www.mbl.edu/education/summer-courses/neural-systems-behavior/)

This course provides broad training in modern approaches to the study of neural mechanisms underlying behavior, perception, and cognition. Through a combination of lectures, exercises, and projects, students investigate neural systems at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels using state-of-the-art techniques. The eight weeks are divided into two-week cycles, providing participants with an in-depth familiarity with several different experimental model systems. In the first cycle, students study a simple invertebrate model system to develop general experimental skills in electrophysiology, neuroanatomy, and quantitative analysis of physiological and behavioral data. In subsequent cycles, students work on a series of different preparations, providing them with a breadth of knowledge in the field. The list of experimental model systems is updated year-to-year, but always includes a diverse array of vertebrate and invertebrate preparations, chosen to illustrate key concepts and novel techniques in the field. The goal of the course is to expose students to diverse approaches to the investigation of the neural basis of behavior.


## [OIST Computational Neuroscience Course (DL: February 5, 2017)](https://groups.oist.jp/ocnc)
*Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Okinawa, Japan ~ June 26 - July 13, 2017*

The aim of the Okinawa Computational Neuroscience Course is to provide opportunities for young researchers with theoretical backgrounds to learn the latest advances in neuroscience, and for those with experimental backgrounds to have hands-on experience in computational modeling.

## [Chemical Neuromodulation: Neurobiological, Neurocomputational, Behavioural and Clinical (DL: February 13, 2017)](http://www.fens.org/Training/FENS-Schools/FENS-SfN-Summer-School-2017/)
*Bertinoro, Italy ~ June 18 - 24, 2017*

Chemical neuromodulation refers to that set of neurotransmitter systems that arise in the subcortical brain to influence the functions of forebrain networks to produce behaviour and cognitive outputs, under a variety of different states of arousal. These neurotransmitter systems, which include the monoamines such as dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin, as well as acetylcholine and orexin, are implicated in diverse behavioural and physiological functions and have been implicated in many neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. The systems have been extensively researched in isolation but have rarely been directly compared experimentally or in conceptual terms; hence one theme of this School will be to make such comparisons.

The basic neuroscience of these neurotransmitter systems will be covered by lectures and discussion groups by an international faculty. Organization and functions of the systems will be compared using a range of multidisciplinary techniques and approaches. These will include the use of novel neuroscience tools provided by opto- and chemo-genetics, electrophysiology, neuropharmacological techniques such as in vivo voltammetry, combined with sophisticated theoretical approaches from cognitive and behavioural neuroscience, including neurocomputational approaches and neuroimaging in experimental animals and humans. Clinical applications will also be covered. 


## [Nengo Summer School (DL: February 15, 2017)](http://www.nengo.ca/summerschool)
*Waterloo University, Waterloo, Canada ~ June 4 - June 16, 2017*

This two-week school will teach participants how to use the Nengo simulation package to build state-of-the-art cognitive and neural models. Nengo has been used to build what is currently the world's largest functional brain model, Spaun, and provides users with a versatile and powerful environment for modelling cognitive and neural systems to run in simulation and on neuromorphic hardware. We welcome applications from all interested graduate students, research associates, postdocs, professors, and industry professionals. No specific training in the use of modelling software is required, but we encourage applications from active researchers with a relevant background in psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, computer science, robotics, neuromorphic engineering, or a related field.

The main goal of the summer school is to have participants learn to build state-of-the-art neural or cognitive models using Nengo. Participants are encouraged to bring their own ideas for projects, which may focus on testing hypotheses, modelling neural or cognitive data, implementing specific behavioural functions with neurons, expanding past models, or provide a proof-of-concept of various neural mechanisms. Projects can be focused on software, hardware, or a combination of both.


## [Frontier in Neurophotonics (DL: March 1, 2017)](https://neurophotonics.ca/frontiers-in-neurophotonics-summer-school)

Applications are welcome from interested (and interesting) graduate students and postdocs.


## [Methods in Computational Neuroscience (DL:  March 7, 2017)](http://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/methods-in-computational-neuroscience/)
*Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, US ~ July 30 – August 25, 2017*

Animals interact with a complex world, encountering a variety of challenges: They must gather data about the environment, discover useful structures in these data, store and recall information about past events, plan and guide actions, learn the consequences of these actions, etc. These are, in part, computational problems that are solved by networks of neurons, from roughly 100 cells in a small worm to 100 billion in humans. Methods in Computational Neuroscience introduces students to the computational and mathematical techniques that are used to address how the brain solves these problems at levels of neural organization ranging from single membrane channels to operations of the entire brain.

In each of the first three weeks, the course focuses on material at increasing levels of complexity (molecular/cellular, network, cognitive/behavioral), but always with an eye on these questions: Can we derive biologically plausible mechanisms that explain how nervous systems solve specific computational problems that arise in the laboratory or natural environment? Can these problems be decomposed into manageable pieces, and can we relate such mathematical decompositions to the observable properties of individual neurons and circuits? Can we identify the molecular mechanisms that provide the building blocks for these computations, as well as understand how the building blocks are organized into cells and circuits that perform useful functions?


## [Computational Approaches to Memory and Plasticity (DL: March 12, 2016)](https://camp.ncbs.res.in/)
_National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, India ~ July 1 - July 16, **2016**_

PhD students and post-docs from theoretical and/or experimental backgrounds (physics, math, neuroscience, engineering, etc.) are invited to apply. Familiarity with programming, dynamical systems, and/or computational neuroscience is desirable, but not necessary. We may also select a small number of exceptional undergraduate and Masters level students for the course, if they have sufficient background via courses and especially via project / hobby work related to these areas (write in your statement of interest & CV). The course will start with remedial tutorials on neuroscience / math / programming and then work upwards from sub-cellular electrical and chemical signaling in neurons, onward to micro-circuits and networks, all with an emphasis on learning, memory and plasticity.


## [Brains, Minds and Machines (DL: March 14, 2017)](http://www.mbl.edu/education/courses/brains-minds-and-machines/)
*Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, US ~ August 13 – September 3, 2017*

The basis of intelligence – how the brain produces intelligent behavior and how we may be able to replicate intelligence in machines – is arguably the greatest problem in science and technology. To solve it, we will need to understand how human intelligence emerges from computations in neural circuits, with rigor sufficient to reproduce similar intelligent behavior in machines. Success in this endeavor ultimately will enable us to understand ourselves better, to produce smarter machines, and perhaps even to make ourselves smarter. Today’s AI technologies, such as Watson and Siri, are impressive, but their domain specificity and reliance on vast numbers of labeled examples are obvious limitations; few view this as brain-like or human intelligence. The synergistic combination of cognitive science, neurobiology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science holds the promise to build much more robust and sophisticated algorithms implemented in intelligent machines. The goal of this course is to help produce a community of leaders that is equally knowledgeable in neuroscience, cognitive science, and computer science and will lead the development of true biologically inspired AI.


## [Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience (CCN) Summer School (DL: March 15, 2017)](http://www.ccnss.org/)
*NYU Shanghai, Shanghai, China ~ July 6 – 29, 2017*

esigned to emphasize higher cognitive functions and their underlying neural circuit mechanisms, the course aims at training talented and highly motivated students and postdoctoral fellows from Asia and other countries across the world. Applicants with quantitative (including Physics, Mathematics, Engineering and Computer Science) or experimental background are welcomed. The lectures will introduce the basic concepts and methods, as well as cutting-edge research on higher brain functions such as decision-making, attention, learning and memory. Modeling will be taught at multiple levels, ranging from single neuron computation, microcircuits and large-scale systems, to normative theoretical approach. Python-based programming labs coordinated with the lectures will provide practical training in important computational methods.


## [Interacting with neural circuits (DL:  March 20, 2017)](http://www.fens.org/Training/CAJAL-programme/CAJAL-Courses-2017/Interacting-with-neural-circuits/)
*Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Portugal ~ July 2 – 22, 2017*

Understanding how activity in neural circuits drives behavior is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Making this link requires detailed information about the cell types and their connectivity, as well as the spatiotemporal patterns of activity in neural circuits in the intact brain during behaviour. Moreover, probing causal relationships between cellular and circuit-level processes and behaviour requires perturbation of specific elements of the circuit in a temporally and spatially precise manner. This course will highlight the new anatomical, optical, genetic, electrophysiological, and pharmacogenetic approaches that are available for addressing these challenges. The faculty will discuss tool development through to their implementation in diverse model systems. Students will learn the potential and limitations of these techniques, allowing them to both design and interpret experiments correctly.


## [Advanced Techniques for Synapse Biology (DL:  March 20, 2017)](http://www.fens.org/Training/CAJAL-programme/CAJAL-Courses-2017/ATSB2017/)
*Bordeaux Neurocampus, France ~ July 3 – 23, 2017*

Synapses are the major sites of information processing in the brain. The complexity of the synapse has been described in the past few years in great molecular details and major achievements have been gained in the understanding of networks of proteins occurring at the pre-synaptic cytomatrix and the postsynaptic compartment of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Synaptic dysfunction is a central aspect of many brain disorders (“synaptopathies”) and synapses are and potentially will be the main target of drugs for brain diseases. Synapses integrate complex signals through temporal and spatial codes and undergo rapid structural and functional changes (synaptic plasticity) that underlie the formation of engrams in the brain. Maladaptation of such processes can lead to aberrant perception, cognitive dysfunction or neurodegeneration. The study of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic function and -plasticity are the key to understanding of how the brain works and what goes wrong in brain disease. The advanced course will expose students to state-of-art techniques for molecular imaging and functional methodologies, through direct hands-on experiments.


## [CAJAL Course in Computational Neuroscience (DL:  March 20, 2017)](http://www.fens.org/Training/CAJAL-programme/CAJAL-Courses-2017/CCCN2017/)

## [Ion channels in the brain in health and disease (DL: ???)](http://www.fens.org/Training/CAJAL-programme/CAJAL-Courses-2017/Ion-channels/)
*Bordeaux Neurocampus, France ~ September 4 – 22, 2017*

Ion channels play a major role in neuronal excitability. Diseases, termed channelopathies, are related to inherited or acquired dysfunctions of ion channels:  epilepsy, migraine, ataxia and deafness. Roughly 15% of known therapeutic drugs including anaesthetics, analgesics, anti-epileptics and anxiolytics have their primary action on ion channels, making them the second largest target class after G-protein coupled receptors. With the advent of a better understanding of cellular physiology and identification of the molecular components that constitute individual channel types and/or control their activity, rational molecular-based strategies to identify ion channel modulators are now within reach.

We are organizing a summer course to provide promising young investigators with a comprehensive introduction to state-of-the-art techniques in ion channel study,  including - but not limited - to genetics, electrophysiology, imaging, as well as structure-function and pathophysiological approaches. This 3-week course is a practical “hands-on” introduction to advanced methods in ion channel recording and analysis and will cover sufficient background such that all participants will be able to establish these techniques in their home laboratories. 


## [Connectomics: from Micro- to Meso- and Macro-Scales (DL: ???)](http://www.fens.org/Training/CAJAL-programme/CAJAL-Courses-2017/Connectomics/)
*Bordeaux Neurocampus, France, Portugal ~ October 2 – 21, 2017*

The CAJAL course in Connectomics is an intensive three-week course that guides participants through the theory and practice of state-of the art methods to address pertinent questions in the field of structural/functional connectomics from mice to man. This goal will be achieved through a unique balance of lectures from world-wide experts in their respective fields to experimental demonstrations and hands-on laboratory work in small groups. During the course each participant will become familiar with a range of approaches, ranging from connectivity studies in the brain slice and in vivo in the behaving brain using electrophysiological, calcium imaging, optogenetic, viral trans-synaptic tracing, whole brain clearing and neuroimaging approaches with magnetic resonance imaging (functional and structural imaging) in both mice and human subjects (performed on the participants) and postmortem tissue.

_University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada ~ August 1-7, **2016**_

Deep neural networks that learn to represent data in multiple layers of increasing abstraction have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art for speech recognition, object recognition, object detection, predicting the activity of drug molecules, and many other tasks. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large datasets by building distributed representations, either via supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning.

This summer schools is aimed at graduate students and industrial engineers and researchers who already have some basic knowledge of machine learning (and possibly but not necessarily of deep learning) and wish to learn more about this rapidly growing field of research.

## [Advanced Scientific Programming in Python (DL: ???)](https://python.g-node.org/wiki/)
*Reading, UK ~ September 5-10, 2016*

Scientists spend more and more time writing, maintaining, and debugging software. While techniques for doing this efficiently have evolved, only few scientists have been trained to use them. As a result, instead of doing their research, they spend far too much time writing deficient code and reinventing the wheel. In this course we will present a selection of advanced programming techniques and best practices which are standard in the industry, but especially tailored to the needs of a programming scientist. Lectures are devised to be interactive and to give the students enough time to acquire direct hands-on experience with the materials. Students will work in pairs throughout the school and will team up to practice the newly learned skills in a real programming project — an entertaining computer game.
